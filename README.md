# ST Messaging Application
Welcome to the ST Chat App!
This is a full-stack real-time application designed using several AWS modules, coupled with a smooth and cohesive front-end that gives users the ability to chat live, both privately and in groups, with their friends anywhere around the world. Upon signign up/logging in, they can create group chats of up to 5 friends using our clean and easy to follow UI, as well as scroll through the groups they are already in via the sidebar on the left.

Please note that the large majority of the backend code is comprised of AWS Lambda functions stored in an entirely different datasphere, however you can enjoy all of the front-end development housed in this github repository.
